This example uses a shipping scenerio to display this application.

This app is a CRUD system that uses php, html, css and javascript,ajax all displaying data from a postgres database.

The ECeditMulti.php page displays all available shipments for a carrier to bid on and come pick up from the dock. 
Only the available slots display in this list because the query uses where email = "open". Once the bidder enters an email
the shipment is no longer displayed in this  list. It is however, added to the calender view of the shippers admin where
this admin can do some basic editing from the calendar view. I have disabled drag and drop features in calendar to keep it
basic.
